Selenium Tests Rakuten
Project can be executed by going to src/test/java/tests/ , right click and RUN or ,

By giving the command ' mvn test' in the path of the project.

The reports will be generated in the folder ExtentReports/ExtentReportsResults.html.

For the chromedriver and geckodriver to work i have created ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE in the PATH with the folder that contains them so that we have no hardcoded driver path.
